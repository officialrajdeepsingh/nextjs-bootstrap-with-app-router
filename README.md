## Getting Started

First clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/officialrajdeepsingh/nextjs-bootstrap-with-app-router.git` command, and run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Note
Remove the  `output: "export"` configuration in `next.config.js` file; it is only important when you deploy the Next.js app router on GitHub pages.
